NAVIGATING THE MAIN WORK REP
#############################

You are now in the report/portfolio section of the project. This contains all the code files. All credit to the authors.


To navigate the code, it is recommended that you follow the suggested order (from file 1 - to file 7 - ), as certain works may sometimes reference previous ones. However, any file  may be run independently, as the data dependencies are all accounted for in the relevant subfolders (either Data or Pickles).


Files 1 - 6 present all the work done towards establishing a functional ensemble of methods for the goal of predicting genres of songs using only their lyrics. 


File 7 presents a practical application of the project, combining the former into a single algorithm. 


External undocumented work exists and may be made available upon request. Authors reserve their right to disclose undocumented work at will only and should be contacted for its review.
