# Genre from lyrics recognition
 Repository dedicated to a project involving NLP analysis of lyrics for the purpose of genre classification for various songs.
 
 ## Objective
 Inquiries into understanding artistic drive have often been unsuccesful, as there is major unpredictability in human expression. However, recent exponential advancements in data storage and utilisation may help us better understand what artists convey by identifying patterns. Such is the case for genres which, whilst having strong musical foundations in terms of rythm, beat, instruments etc. cover a plethora of diversity when it comes to their lyrics. Therefore, we ought to ask the question: Can we judge a song's genre by only looking at its lyrics?
